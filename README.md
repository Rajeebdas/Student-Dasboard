## Problem Statement

Educational institutions need an efficient way to analyze student performance across multiple branches and subjects. This project creates an interactive Power BI dashboard that aggregates and visualizes academic data, providing insights into student grades and performance trends. The dashboard helps administrators and educators make data-driven decisions to improve academic strategies and student support.


### Steps followed 

- Data Collection and CSV Loading:
Collected academic performance data in CSV format, containing student grades across various branches and subjects. Loaded the CSV files into Power BI using the "Get Data" option.

- Data Cleaning and Transformation:
Cleaned the data by handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and ensuring proper data types. Used Power Query Editor for data transformation and ensured that data was structured for analysis.

- Data Modeling:
Created relationships between different tables (e.g., students, branches, subjects) to enable efficient analysis and visualization. Established primary and foreign keys for relational data.

- Visualization Creation:
Designed various charts and visuals, including bar charts, line charts, and tables, to display student performance across different branches and subjects. Added slicers and filters for interactivity.

- Dashboard Design:
Combined all visualizations into a single dashboard layout, optimizing the design for user experience. Ensured clear, concise, and visually appealing representations of data.

- Testing and Validation:
Tested the dashboard with sample data to ensure accuracy of visualizations and that the interactivity functions as expected.

- Final Refinement:
Made adjustments to improve visual appeal, added tooltips for better insights, and ensured all metrics were displayed effectively.

- Deployment and Sharing:
Published the report to the Power BI service and shared the final dashboard with stakeholders or users for analysis and decision-making.
